Nodepool uses the 'env-vars' key from the DIB image definition when building
the image but these are not persisted and available at boot time.

This element generates a wrapper script so that configure_mirror.sh is called
with the right configuration when used as a ready-script.

It also generates a wrapper script so that multinode_setup.sh is called with
the right configuration for mirrors when used as a ready-script.

Additionally, it installs Java for the Jenkins slave to run as the upstream
image no longer uses Jenkins (or Java).
